\title{Accessing the NBA API}
\description{
The \pkg{nba} package is designed to make accessing the NBA API
(\link{stat.com.nba}) easier. It provides functions to download, for example,
shot chart data or play-by-play data. Additionally it provides graphical
functions to plot court markings, which can be used in conjunction with the
shot chart data.
